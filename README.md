## 🎨 Visualizations

Visualizations play a crucial role in understanding data. Below are some examples of what you can create using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

### Example 1: Line Chart

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Line Chart Example")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.show()
```

### Example 2: Bar Chart

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = {'categories': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'values': [4, 7, 1]}
sns.barplot(x='categories', y='values', data=data)
plt.title("Bar Chart Example")
plt.show()
```

These examples illustrate how you can visualize data effectively using Python libraries.
